# HOW TO USE/BE AWARE
Do not use my textures or models for commercial purposes, my content its free and I do NOT accept this type of shit.
Be aware if someone try to make you download one of my textures or models, the only platform I use to upload my stuff its github,
my name is pretty common, so to know if its me or not, certify that my name its "Ryo Hiro 996" the numbers represent my OG name from gamebanana!
And if you're still on doubts, just verify the socials, like the youtube or tiktok. Its the same name lol (And I'm the only one that can say Frickin Brazilian)
